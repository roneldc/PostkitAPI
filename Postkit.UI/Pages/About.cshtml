    <h1 class="display-5 fw-bold mb-4">About Postkit</h1>

    <p class="text-muted fs-5 mb-4">
        <strong>Postkit</strong> is a modular, scalable Web API built with ASP.NET Core 8, Entity Framework Core, and Identity.
        It demonstrates clean architecture and real-world features such as role-based access, JWT authentication, and SignalR notifications.
        Designed as both a learning resource and a portfolio-ready backend for social and community-style applications.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mb-2">Purpose</h2>
    <p class="text-muted mb-4">
        This project serves to practice and showcase modular architecture, separation of concerns, real-time event handling, and modern API design.
        It adheres to contemporary .NET best practices and is extensible for future features like replies, search, filtering, and analytics.

    <ul class="mb-4 text-muted">
        <li>ASP.NET Core 8 (Web API)</li>
        <li>Entity Framework Core (Code-first)</li>
        <li>ASP.NET Identity with JWT Authentication</li>
        <li>SignalR for real-time notifications</li>

    <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mb-2">Modular Design</h2>
    <p class="text-muted mb-4">
        Postkit is organized by feature, with each encapsulated in its own class library
        (<em>Post, Comment, Reaction, Notification</em>) to ensure clear separation of concerns and maintainability.
        The <code class="bg-light px-2 py-1 rounded small">Postkit.Shared</code> project contains reusable DTOs, enums, and interfaces shared across all modules.
